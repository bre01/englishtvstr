During your weekend here,

you will explore ways through yoga,



2

breathing and other mindful practices



3

to reconnect with yourself

and your partner.



4

Also, for a small donation,



5

we have an on-site shaman

who can heal your chakras.



6

Small donation?

Sounds like a "chakra con".



7

You're supposed to turn that off.



8

- I'm sorry. It's work.

- Okay, so is a marriage.



9

You know, we traveled all this

way. The least you could do



10

is take this seriously.



11

I'm sorry. You're right.



12

Oh, my God, that... that

crappy breakfast was $55.



13

- For flax and berries.

- Yeah.



14

I thought this was supposed to

be one fee up front, all in.



15

I wish<i> you</i> were all in, Mitchell.



16

I'm sor... I am. Starting... now. Okay?



17

That wasn't me.



18

I have invited the Tibetan

Singing Bowl to ring,



19

reminding us to all turn down the volume



20

and find the beauty in silence.



21

That was unfortunate.



22

My apologies. We happen to be

next door to the Royals.



23

Oh, my God, we just binged "The Crown".



24

W-W-Which royals? William and Kate?



25

Harry and the "Suits" girl?



26

Actually, it's the Kansas City

Royals. Spring training,



27

their practice field is next door.



28

Growing up a Royals fan,

it was always my dream



29

to see them at spring training.



30

So, I just decided,

after the retreat was over,



31

I'm just gonna swing by,

you know, grab an autograph,



32

maybe whisper an opinion

in the manager's ear,



33

be discovered as a great baseball mind.



34

Then the Yankees would come calling,



35

and then I'd have to choose

between the team I love



36

and the... the big payout.



37

But I'm getting ahead of myself.



38

Not to worry. This is

their last day of training,



39

and they leave tonight.



40

- Excuse me, question.

- Yes.



41

Yes, hi. Will we have

an opportunity to explore



42

these... these beautiful

grounds on our own?



43

Absolutely. Tomorrow at sunset.



44

After goat yoga.



45

Oh, my God! Can it get any worse?!

47

Arrgh! Ughh!



48

What are you doing? I grunted less

when I was giving birth to Joe.



49

You were pushing six and a half

pounds, I'm pushing 220.



50

You're dressing younger.



51

You're exercising.



52

You only had one breakfast this morning.



53

- Who is she, Jay? I'll kill her.

- Relax, would ya?



54

I'm just trying to get in shape.



55

Okay, but hurry, because we have to go



56

and pick up Joe at the birthday party.



57

Wait a minute.



58

Is that what this is all about...



59

Henry's father?



60

I don't understand

why you're so insecure



61

just because he's younger,



62

stronger, and more rugged than you are.



63

Go easy. I'm working on

only one breakfast.



64

Joe won't shut up about

his new friend's dad.



65

"Henry's dad is so tough". Who cares?



66

He was a stunt double in

a couple of "Bourne" movies.



67

From the first time Joe went over there,



68

that guy's been trying

to prove how cool he is.



69

Joe! Let's go!



70

Heads up!



71

- What the hell?!

- Yeah!



72

He's Jason Bourne!



73

That's make-believe.



74

Matt Damon's Jason Bourne.



75

Growing up, I thought

my dad was the coolest.



76

And that made me feel good about myself.



77

I mean, I try to stay with it.



78

Exactly! Look at you,

you even have a smart watch.



79

Yeah, the damn thing tells me

when to stand up,



80

when to breathe.



81

- <i>Your body mass index is...</i>

- Nobody asked!



82

Which have more chromosomes,

potatoes or humans?



83

Humans, right? Potatoes?!



84

Oh, Krazy Kups, what can't you teach us?



85

Are you doing all this to

impress Haley's boyfriend?



86

Haley's dating this genius

astrophysics professor



87

who's somehow making her smarter



88

because, last week,

I called Pluto a planet



89

and Haley laughed at me.



90

In pity.



91

- Haley.

- Haley.



92

Haley.



93

Do we think that Haley

is suited to a professor,



94

because I more saw her

with a Gilligan type?



95

Come on, now. Lots of happy couples



96

aren't the exact same level of smart.



97

That's true. We work.



98

Yeah.



99

Wait. When you say, "We work,"



100

do you think you're smarter

than me or I'm smarter than you?



101

I think I'm smart enough

not to have this conversation.



102

Oh, my God!



103

You do! You think

you're smarter than me!



104

Okay, hotshot.

How many patents do you have?



105

Headscratcher TM, Aspirin Gun,



106

Polite Car Horn that'll

put an end to road rage.



107

Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.



108

Can we just not get into a whole

thing before this lunch?



109

What lunch? I just ate a pie.



110

Your sister is dating

a professor of astrophysics,



111

and he's coming here today to meet us.



112

Oh, good, someone to talk to.



113

I'm tired of dumbing it down

for you chuckle-heads.



114

Bill, are you on your way?



115

Stay in the car. I'll meet you outside.



116

It was hard for me when Haley

started dating Arvin,



117

my professor and science hero and...



118

okay, fine, crush.



119

I was so upset, I went home,

and I may have overindulged...



120

on Bagel Bites.



121

- Hey.

- Aah!



122

It's okay. You're safe.



123

But I'm gonna need you to come with me.



124

I don't really think you need... Okay.



125

<i>He was like a superhero.</i>



126

Is that your dad?



127

<i>A beautiful... not-so-smart superhero.</i>



128

The last thing I wanted

was Professor Fennerman



129

finding out I was dating a dummy.



130

A sweet, chiseled dummy.



131

Alex, you didn't mention you've

got a firefighter boyfriend.



132

Yeah! It's great.



133

"Take that, you fire". We gotta go.



134

Oh, but your parents just

invited me to stay for lunch.



135

Score!



136

By the way, you look way younger

than your poster.



137

We really should get going before we...



138

we miss our plans and stuff, right?



139

- Yeah.

- Uh, yeah...



140

Alex! I didn't know you were

joining us for lunch.



141

Oh! No, no.



142

My friend and I have some plans

we really can't get out of.



143

Oh, no, I could totally just

show you "Backdraft" later.



144

It's my brother's DVD.

He doesn't even know I took it.



145

- So...

- Mom, Dad, this is Arvin.



146

Hello, Arvin.

It's a pleasure to meet you.



147

Yes, you are the first TED

Talkin' science superstar



148

- we've ever had in our house.

- Mm-hmm.



149

Well, as long as I'm a

"superstar" and not a supernova.



150

You don't even know what

you're laughing at.



151

- I get it.

- I got it more.



152

I don't get it, but, uh, you

sound like Austin Powers, man.



153

Wow. Henry's dad did such a great job



154

with the birthday party

for the kids, huh?



155

"Henry's dad". "Henry's dad".



156

I took Joe to see "African Queen"

in CinemaScope.



157

Oh, hey. Good to see you again, Jay.



158

- Hi.

- Hi, I'm Clay.



159

I'd shake your hand,

but I'm a little banged up.



160

I fell out of a five-story

building this morning,



161

- into a net.

- He fell out of bed this morning.



162

Hey, honey.

Come down and meet these guys.



163

Oh, hey!



164

Welcome. I'm Jenny, Henry's mom.



165

Joe's parents... Jay, Gloria.



166

- Hi.

- Gloria.



167

Mama! Henry's mom just did

the wall so fast!



168

You try it.



169

Oh, I climb already into

these heels this morning.



170

It's too much for me today.



171

- I'm going up again!

- Okay.



172

Oh, I used to love

wearing shoes like that.



173

But after marching around in

combat boots for two years,



174

I made a deal with my feet

I would never hurt them again.



175

My beautiful wife did two tours in Iraq.



176

Wow, Gloria, you're not that different.



177

Yesterday, she did

two tours of a sales rack.



178

Help! I'm too high!



179

Go ahead, just jump,

buddy. I'll catch ya.



180

- But your sciatica!

- I'm on it.



181

What is the hurry? He's on a rope.



182

- She's making quite a meal out of this.

- Yeah.



183

Attaboy.



184

Thank you, Jenny. You're so cool.



185

Ah, look at that, Gloria. She saved him.



186

Just like she saved America.



187

Can I have some more cake?

Jenny made it.



188

I used to cook for my squadron.



189

You've done so many great things



190

that you keep telling us about.



191

Here we are...

our sensory deprivation tanks



192

will disconnect you from the world



193

and connect you with yourselves.



194

Okay, so, this looks a little coffin-y.



195

So, I'm not so sure... about my husband.



196

He had an MRI last year,

and he sort of freaked out.



197

So, do you have anything bigger,



198

like, an indoor pool or a family tank?



199

Okay, Mitchell, I-I'm fine.



200

We're here to evolve and grow...



201

So, the float lasts for one hour,



202

during which most people

simply experience



203

a deep, relaxed state.



204

Most people? W-What about the rest?

W-What do they experience?



205

Okay, a-are these scratches

on this lid here?



206

Oh, come on, Mitchell.

The flower that blooms in adversity



207

is the most rare and beautiful of all.



208

Very well put.



209

He didn't make that up.

It's from "Mulan".



210

Our daughter made us

watch it a thousand times.



211

I... Well, I'm lashing! Okay,

maybe we should just float.



212

- Yeah, yeah, okay.

- Let's just float.



213

Okay.



214

I tried to relax in there, I really did.



215

But it was difficult.



216

I-I guess because I felt

like I was, um...



217

Oh, what's the word?



218

Dying.



219

<i>But I got past that,</i>



220

<i>only to start reliving every

mistake I have ever made,</i>



221

<i>like when I went to

an Oscar party and I said</i>



222

<i>"Bett" Davis in front of a room

full of vicious gays.</i>



223

Honestly, the only thing

that kept me in there



224

was the knowledge that Cam

was right next door.



225

Go Royals! I-I love you!



226

It was a solid plan...



227

just go for a quick peek,

take some pictures,



228

run back, splash some water in my hair,



229

"Oh, Mitchell, isn't floating

so relaxing?"



230

Got it!



231

Nice catch.



232

- Oh.

- That was good.



233

Oh, my gosh. Uh, M-Mr. Brett.

I didn't know you would be here.



234

Hi. Call me George.



235

- Oh, George.

- Yeah, how are ya?



236

- Uh, good. My name's Cameron.

- Nice to meet you, Cam.



237

Nice to meet you. Been a fan for...



238

Hey, do you mind if I get a picture?



239

Not at all. Not at all.

300 bucks, how's that sound?



240

I'm retired.



241

- 300?

- I'm just kidding.



242

Come on, it's free.



243

Okay... Ow!



244

Alright. There it is.



245

- There they are!

- There ya go!



246

Well, listen, I don't want to

take up too much of your time.



247

- Thank you s...

- I got all the time in the world.



248

I'm not playing. I'm just coaching.



249

- Okay.

- Yeah. Come here.



250

Let me tell you the story

about the Pine Tar game.



251

- Oh, wow!

- You wanna hear that?



252

- Sure.

- Come on.



253

- Okay.

- But first, let me tell you about...



254

I'm gonna tell you about dinner

the night before.



255

You must be the genius boyfriend.



256

That is what the guys call me.



257

They're always, like, you know,



258

"Hey, genius". I'm like, "Hey, guys".



259

So, tell me, are there aliens?



260

You kidding? 100%.



261

Oh, I knew it. Wait,

and the zombiepocalypse?



262

Dude, I tell everyone,



263

"Start building up an immunity

to zombie bites. Now".



264

I'm so glad we talked.



265

Um. Sorry for the interruption.



266

- Everything okay?

- Well, the short story is, yes.



267

The long story is, the theory

on which I've based



268

much of my career

has just been disproven.



269

What? Your Vacuum Energy

Density Theory?



270

- I'm... I'm so sorry.

- Me, too.



271

That was the density theory

I thought really worked.



272

Really, Phil, what

was your second choice?



273

Well, that's all part of

the process, isn't it?



274

My theory actually invalidated

someone else's.



275

He jumped off a building...



276

just very dramatic.



277

But, well, I'm British.

So, no worries.



278

What smells so good?



279

Uh. Uh, it's the chicken!



280

So, Bill, you are a firefighter?



281

Yeah, my three favorite things

are helping people,



282

sliding down poles,

and hanging off trucks,



283

so I figured might as well

make a career out of it.



284

Well, it's good that

your favorite things



285

weren't chloroform, duct tape,

and windowless vans.



286

Claire, the joke is he'd be a kidnapper.



287

I got it.



288

You know, Phil used to think

it was "duck" tape.



289

Like, duck.



290

Claire didn't understand

the ending of "La La Land".



291

Sorry. They're not normally like this.



292

Clearly, they're going through something



293

they can't even drop

for one important lunch.



294

They're arguing over who's smarter,



295

and there's only one way to settle it.



296

Another time, in the presence

of a marriage counselor?



297

Nope. Brain Battle.



298

No. No, we're not doing that right now.



299

I'm so sorry, Arvin. We're being silly.



300

"How many presidents died in office?"



301

- Eight.

- Six.



302

The correct answer is eight.



303

- Ha! Ha!

- Damn it. Give me another one.



304

Why was six afraid of seven?



305

'Cause seven, eight, nine.



306

Like he "ate" it.



307

"Who wrote 'Moby Dick'?"



308

Herman Munster. <i>Herman</i> Munster.



309

- Herman Melville.

- Melville!



310

"How many moons does Jupiter have?"



311

Oh, is it alright if I take this one?



312

- Mm-hmm.

- 27.



313

67.



314

Hmm? No, that's... that's wrong.



315

67 is Uranus and Jupiter's 27,

right, Alex?



316

Actually, no.



317

But it's a simple mistake, though.



318

- You just flipped them.

- Well, this is mortifying, isn't it?



319

I have a doctorate

in astrophysics. Idiot.



320

First, some puffed-up Swedes

invalidate my life's work.



321

And then I'm bested by

a little bedtime gurgle cup!



322

I'm sorry. I'm going to need a moment.



323

67 moons. What an idiot.



324

Well, all's I know is



325

the Earth only has one moon



326

and I saw a documentary

and we didn't even land on it.



327

Oh, my God, stop talking.



328

You know, you're being kind of mean.



329

I'm gonna need a moment, too.



330

This is why I don't bring

boyfriends home.



331

Why didn't you ask me before

inviting him to lunch?



332

"This Paul Newman character

had a 'cool hand'?"



333

- Luke!

- Yep.



334

Counts! Counts.



335

Henry's dad climbed the wall

with one hand! It was awesome!



336

Yeah, well, his career

rides on Matt Damon



337

not doing any artsy, think-y movies,



338

so I wouldn't count on Henry



339

going to your school much longer.



340

What the hell? I made that light.



341

Oh, geez. Another ticket.



342

Henry's mom drove a tank!



343

"Henry's mom!" "Henry's mom!"



344

- What are you doing, Gloria?

- I want to see Henry's mom do this!



345

Yay! He's chasing us!



346

This feels like a bad idea.



347

Okay, too late, because

I'm already committed!



348

<i>Heart rate... high.</i>



349

- <i>Heart rate... high.

- What is the plan, Gloria?</i>



350

We're going to the mall!



351

You know why I tease you

about your shopping?



352

Well, you do have a problem.



353

Okay, get down and don't move.



354

That's gonna be tough.

I can smell Cinnabon.



355

Hey!



356

- Where have you been?

- Oh, hey.



357

I just stayed in the tank

a little... a little extra.



358

How... What a great experience.



359

- Just being alone with yourself...

- Oh, I was never alone.



360

I-I saw the face of every bully,

I replayed every humiliation...



361

Is this about "Bett" Davis again?



362

Okay, we had just watched

"Ruthless People".



363

You're thinking Midler.

You gotta let it go.



364

I know. I'm... I'm gonna try.



365

But as scared as I was in there,



366

I kept thinking about how



367

you're the one person

who makes me feel safe.



368

And it made me want to be

a better husband



369

and to be more present,

to be more understanding, to...



370

Why... Why's your face red?



371

- Oh, is it?

- Yeah.



372

Oh, just probably 'cause

of the toxins, you know...



373

And your arms, too,

but only up to the...



374

You have a farmer's tan.



375

What have I told you

about that expression?



376

- I can say it...

- Oh, my...



377

T-T-That's why you're burned.

You went Royal watching!



378

I was only gonna stay for

a second, but George Brett...



379

George... George Brett cornered me.



380

And you know how I am

with famous people. I can't say "No".



381

Remember when I spent

the entire day at the pool



382

with Downtown Julie Brown?



383

You shamed me into coming here



384

only to leave me soaking

in a bowl of trauma soup?



385

Okay, whoa, whoa.

W-What happened about be...



386

being more understanding?



387

I can't believe you're turning

this into my fault.



388

This is so like you, Cam.



389

Hello, again.



390

Please follow me to

your guided silent meditation.



391

Before we begin,



392

the chef has asked me

to reassure everyone



393

that there's nothing wrong

with the tempeh.



394

It's supposed to taste that way.



395

Alright.



396

Deep breath. In through the nose.



397

Out through the mouth.



398

Only in silence can we be truly present.



399

But be prepared...



400

errant feelings may arise.



401

Anxiety, doubt, anger...



402

Now, take a breath

and let those feelings pass



403

like clouds in the sky.



404

The tension is melting away.



405

That's it.



406

Live in this moment of serenity

and stillness.



407

We're so accustomed to



408

going, going, going.

But we need to just stop.



409

Ask yourself the important questions.



410

Are you running away

from difficult feelings?



411

Are you holding on to petty grievances?



412

Are you being the best you?



413

It's not too late to find your way back.



414

To the light,



415

to forgiveness,



416

to love.



417

It was amazing.



418

There were no words,



419

but I could feel Cam



420

taking full responsibility

for our fight.



421

Total silence, but Mitchell's eyes said,



422

"It's all on me".



423

You know, "I was wrong.

What would I do without you?"



424

It was a beautiful weekend.



425

Plus, George Brett signed my ball.



426

Oh, "To Cam, all my best wishes,

George Brett.



427

P.S. We are not done with this"?



428

Mitchell!



429

Did you write on my ball?!



430

Hey, where's Bill?



431

I don't know. He's probably outside.



432

When he gets agitated,

he likes to climb stuff.



433

That lunch was insane.

Can you believe Mom and Dad?



434

No, and, uh, I can't believe you either.



435

You're so mean to Bill.



436

What do you have against hot people?



437

- What did we ever do to you?

- You lost me.



438

You're gonna blow it with that guy,



439

and he's really nice.



440

Why do you have to

make him feel so dumb?



441

Okay, you don't know

what you're talking about.



442

Oh, yes, I do.



443

Because it's the same way

you've always treated me.



444

It sucks.



445

You know what Arvin never does?



446

Makes me feel less smart than him.



447

So, who cares if Bill's

not a member of Menses?



448

Look, this is the first

boyfriend you've ever had



449

that is age appropriate, employed,



450

and doesn't look like

he's dying on a ship.



451

I wouldn't say "boyfriend".



452

He's more like a guilty pleasure.



453

Guilty or not, that's the first

time I've ever heard you



454

describe a guy as a "pleasure".



455

Bill, I'm sorry!



456

All good, babe.



457

You're the one fire I can't put out.



458

Well, also grease is pretty tricky.



459

Arvin?



460

Oh.



461

Arvin, hi. Are you okay?



462

Yeah. Oh, yes. Yes.



463

Um... yes.



464

I-I-I'm just a-a little embarrassed.



465

We're the ones who should

be embarrassed.



466

We just made lunch so tense and weird.



467

- Yeah.

- Well, I'm...



468

I'm not terribly adept

at handling failure.



469

My parents are both

overachieving academics...



470

a doctor of philosophy

and a doctor of mathematics.



471

- Wow!

- And Father is a doctor of medicine



472

and doctor of economics.



473

I-I'm sorry. I just

need to shake it off.



474

You know, stiff-upper-lip it.



475

Yeah, it's fine.



476

Can we just pretend it never happened?



477

No.



478

No, failure sucks.



479

It's okay to feel bad.



480

Yeah, wallow a little.

Eat some ice cream.



481

Day drink, that's how you

come out the other side.



482

You're... You're like

the inverse of my parents.



483

Except the drinking.



484

They're pickled most of the day.



485

Well, you're not in their house.



486

This is House Dunphy... We fail here.



487

Right. I mean, today our whole goal



488

was to impress you.

We made fools of ourselves.



489

I have a magic shop that's

bleeding money... thousands.



490

- What?

- It's fine.



491

Hey, what's all this, then?



492

Oh, whoa. Did I get that from you?

Am I becoming Madonna?



493

Your parents were actually

being quite lovely.



494

Thank you for taking the time.



495

Oh, and my parents' walls may be adorned



496

with nothing but degrees and awards,



497

but they don't have one tenth

of your emotional intelligence.



498

- Aww!

- Thank you.



499

- But would you say it's an absolutel...

- If you had to pick a winner...



500

- Okay, stop it.

- Just...



501

That was so fun.



502

My heart is racing.



503

You? My watch dialed my cardiologist.



504

I've never run from the cops before.



505

Me either.



506

Lights!



507

I can't wait to tell everyone

how cool you guys are!



508

We're not cool, Joe.



509

That's not what people do

when a policeman pulls them over.



510

In fact, there's nothing cool about us.



511

Well, I don't think

we should be lumped into...



512

Lights!



513

Joe, there are more important

things than being cool.



514

Uh, like what?



515

Look, the point is, Joe,

we love you too much



516

to let you think dumb moves

like this are okay.



517

So, what do we do now?



518

We're gonna do the right thing.



519

Officer!



520

Uh...



521

Where's Cinnabon?



522

Sure enough, they call me out

for using too much pine tar.



523

I run out there and just go

berserk on these umpires.



524

- But everybody remembers...

- Ugh!



525

- Watch out. That's a base.

- Yeah.



526

- That's third base.

- Third base.



527

That's where I used to play.

You remember that?



528

Yeah. Should we do...



529

So, when you would stand here,



530

you would just kind of basically

be in an athletic...



531

I played college football...



532

You would get

right here like this and say,



533

"Please don't hit it to me".



534

That's how I feel!



535

I'm gonna get you back!
