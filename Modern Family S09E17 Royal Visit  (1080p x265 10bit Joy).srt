00:00:02,393 --> 00:00:04,178
During your weekend here,
you will explore ways,

2
00:00:04,308 --> 00:00:06,136
through yoga, breathing,

3
00:00:06,267 --> 00:00:08,095
and other mindful practices,

4
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:11,141
to reconnect with yourself
and your partner.

5
00:00:11,272 --> 00:00:13,230
Also, for a small donation,

6
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:16,146
we have an on-site shaman
who can heal your chakras.

7
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:19,802
Small donation?
Sounds like a "chakra con."

8
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:21,673
[cellphone chimes]Oh.

9
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:23,240
You're supposed
to turn that off.

10
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:24,502
I'm sorry.
It's work.
Okay,
so is a marriage.

11
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:26,069
You know, we traveled all this
way. The least you could do

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,375
is take this
seriously.

13
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:29,029
I'm sorry.
You're right.[cellphone chimes]

14
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:32,162
Oh, my God, that -- that
crappy breakfast was $55.

15
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:34,034
For flax
and berries.
Yeah.

16
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:36,210
I thought this was supposed to
be one fee up front, all in.

17
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,559
I wish youwere all in,
Mitchell.

18
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:40,040
I'm sor-- I am.
Starting...now.

19
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,258
Okay?
Okay.

20
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:42,346
[bell chimes]That wasn't me.

21
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:45,088
I have invited the Tibetan
Singing Bowl to ring,

22
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:47,786
reminding us to all
turn down the volume

23
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:50,267
and find the beauty
in silence.

00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:52,965
[group cheering]

25
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:54,097
That was unfortunate.

26
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:57,057
My apologies. We happen to be
next door to the Royals.

27
00:00:57,187 --> 00:00:59,059
[gasps] Oh, my God,
we just binged The Crown.

28
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:01,191
W-W-Which royals?
William and Kate?

29
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:02,279
Harry and
the Suitsgirl?

30
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,630
Actually, it's the Kansas City
Royals. Spring training,

31
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:07,632
their practice field
is next door.[gasps]

32
00:01:07,763 --> 00:01:09,547
Growing up a Royals fan,
it was always my dream

33
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:11,027
to see them at
spring training.

34
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:13,073
So, I just decided,
after the retreat was over,

35
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:14,204
I'm just gonna swing by,

36
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:15,423
you know, grab an autograph,

37
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:17,947
maybe whisper an opinion
in the manager's ear,

38
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,297
be discovered as
a great baseball mind.

39
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:22,082
Then the Yankees
would come calling,

40
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:24,214
and I'd have to choose
between the team I love

41
00:01:24,345 --> 00:01:25,781
and the -- the big payout.

42
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:27,565
But I'm getting ahead
of myself.

43
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:30,090
RANDY: Not to worry. This is
their last day of training,

44
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,179
and they leave tonight.

45
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:33,528
Excuse me,
question.
Yes.

46
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:35,878
Yes, hi. Will we have
an opportunity to explore

47
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:38,228
these -- these beautiful
grounds on our own?

48
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:40,187
Absolutely.
Tomorrow at sunset.

49
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:42,058
After goat yoga.

What are you doing?
I grunted less

55
00:02:02,992 --> 00:02:04,211
when I was giving birth
to Joe.

56
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:08,215
You were pushing six and a half
pounds, I'm pushing 220.

You're dressing younger.

You're exercising.

00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:14,221
You only had one breakfast
this morning.

Who is she, Jay?
I'll kill her.

I'm just trying to get in shape.

Okay, but hurry,
because we have to go

63
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:23,273
and pick up Joe
at the birthday party.

64
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:24,274
Wait a minute.

65
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:26,146
Is that what this
is all about --

Henry's father?

67
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:29,236
I don't understand
why you're so insecure

68
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:31,063
just because
he's younger,

69
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,240
stronger, and more rugged
than you are.

70
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,112
Go easy. I'm working on
only one breakfast.

71
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:38,027
Joe won't shut up about
his new friend's dad.

Who cares?

He was a stunt double in
a couple of Bournemovies.

From the first time
Joe went over there,

75
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:47,254
that guy's been trying
to prove how cool he is.

83
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:02,399
Growing up, I thought
my dad was the coolest.

84
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,401
And that made me feel
good about myself.

85
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:06,403
I mean,
I try to stay with it.

86
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:09,232
Exactly! Look at you,
you even have a smart watch.

making her smarter

I called Pluto a planet

100

and Haley
laughed at me.

00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:44,441
Do we think that Haley
is suited to a professor,

105
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:47,401
because I more saw her
with a Gilligan type?

When you say, "We work,"

112

do you think you're smarter
than me or I'm smarter than you?

113

I think I'm smart enough
not to have this conversation.

-Aah!
-It's okay. You're safe.

But I'm gonna need you
to come with me.

I don't really
think you need --

138

Okay.

By the way, you look way younger
than your poster.

We really should
get going before we --

we miss our -- our plans
and stuff, right?
Oh.

154

joining us for lunch.

can't get out of.

show you Backdraftlater.

It's my brother's DVD.
He doesn't even know I took it.

sound like Austin Powers, man.

00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:18,856
to see African Queen
in CinemaScope.

176
00:06:18,987 --> 00:06:20,380
Oh, hey.
Good to see you again, Jay.

177
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,946
GLORIA: Hi.Hi, I'm Clay.

178
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:23,644
I'd shake your hand,
but I'm a little banged up.

179
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:25,733
I feel out of a five-story
building this morning,

180
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:26,864
into a net.

181
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:28,518
He fell out of bed
this morning.

182
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:30,085
Ah. Hey, honey.

183
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:31,129
Come down and meet
these guys.

184
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,177
-Oh, hey!
-[chuckling] Wow.

185
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:38,180
Welcome.
I'm Jenny, Henry's mom.

186
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,529
Joe's parents --
Jay, Gloria.

187
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,704
Hi.
Gloria.

188
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:43,620
Mama! Henry's mom just did
the wall so fast!

189
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:44,839
You try it.

190
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:47,537
Oh, I climb already into
these heels this morning.

191
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:49,409
It's too much
for me today.

192
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,149
I'm going up again!

193
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,890
Okay.

194
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,370
Oh, I used to love
wearing shoes like that.

195
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,503
But after marching around in
combat boots for two years,

196
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:59,593
I made a deal with my feet
I would never hurt them again.

197
00:06:59,723 --> 00:07:02,204
[laughter]My beautiful wife
did two tours in Iraq.

198
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:04,511
Oh.Wow, Gloria, you're not
that different.

199
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:08,123
Yesterday, she did
two tours of a sales rack.

200
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:09,124
[laughs]

201
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:11,996
Help! I'm too high!

202
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,521
Oh.
Go ahead, just jump,
buddy. I'll catch ya.

203
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,131
But your sciatica!

204
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:17,872
I'm on it.

205
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:20,788
What is the hurry?
He's on a rope.

206
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,140
She's making quite
a meal out of this.Yeah.

207
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:28,926
[cheers and applause]

208
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:30,667
Attaboy.

209
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:33,409
Thank you, Jenny.
You're so cool.

210
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,238
Ah, look at that, Gloria.
She saved him.

211
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:38,719
Just like she
saved America.

212
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:41,722
Can I have some more cake?
Jenny made it.

213
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:43,419
I used to cook
for my squadron.

214
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,638
You've done so
many great things

215
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:46,117
that you keep
telling us about.

216
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:47,641
[laughs]

217
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:50,644
Here we are --
our sensory deprivation tanks

218
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:51,949
will disconnect you
from the world

219
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,951
and connect you
with yourselves.

220
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,779
Okay, so, this looks
a little coffin-y.

221
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,826
So, I'm not so sure.
About my husband.

222
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:01,611
He had an MRI last year,
and he sort of freaked out.

223
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:03,352
So, do you have
anything bigger,

224
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,615
like, an indoor pool
or a -- a family tank?

225
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,182
Okay, Mitchell,
I'm -- I'm fine.

226
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:09,576
We're here to evolve
and grow...
Well...

227
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:11,186
So, the float lasts
for one hour,

228
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:14,232
during which most people
simply experience

229
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:15,930
a deep, relaxed state.

230
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,148
Most people?
What -- What about the rest?

231
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,715
What -- What do
they experience?

232
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:21,239
Okay, a-are these scratches
on this lid here?Oh, come on, Mitchell.

233
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,677
The flower that blooms
in adversity

234
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,853
is the most rare
and beautiful of all.

235
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:27,811
Very well put.

236
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:29,204
He didn't make that up.
It's from Mulan.

237
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:30,858
Our daughter made us
watch it a thousand times.

238
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,642
Well, I --
Well, I'm lashing!

239
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:34,688
[laughs] Okay,
maybe we should just float.

240
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:38,387
Yeah,
let's just float.Yeah, okay.

241
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,520
Okay.

242
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:46,526
[water trickling]

243
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:47,744
[exhales shakily]

244
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,442
I tried to relax in there,
I really did.

245
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:51,531
But it was difficult.

246
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:53,837
I-I guess because I felt
like I was, um --

247
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,230
Oh, what's the word?

248
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,536
Dying.

249
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,885
But I got past that,

250
00:08:58,015 --> 00:09:00,844
only to start reliving every
mistake I have ever made,

251
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:03,455
like when I went to
an Oscar party and I said

252
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:06,720
"Bett" Davis in front of a room
full of vicious gays.

253
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,635
Honestly, the only thing
that kept me in there

254
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:10,550
was the knowledge that Cam
was right next door.

255
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,465
Go Royals! I-I love you!

256
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:14,684
It was a solid plan --

257
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:16,643
just go for a quick peek,
take some pictures,

258
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,079
run back, splash some water
in my hair,

259
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:21,865
"Oh, Mitchell, isn't floating
so relaxing?"

260
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:22,910
[indistinct shouting]

261
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,739
[bat clangs]

262
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,089
Got it!

263
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:29,220
Nice catch.

264
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:30,700
Oh.
That was good.

265
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:33,529
Oh, my gosh. Uh, M-Mr. Brett.
I didn't know you would be here.

266
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,878
Hi. Call me George.Oh, George.

267
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,098
Yeah, how are ya?Uh, good.
My name's Cameron.

268
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:38,229
Nice to meet you, Cam.

269
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,535
Nice to meet you.
Been a fan for --

270
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,015
Hey, do you mind if
I get a picture?

271
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:41,885
Not at all. Not at all.

272
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,539
300 bucks,
how's that sound?

273
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,062
I'm retired.

274
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:46,542
300?I'm just kidding.

275
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:48,152
Oh.
[both laugh]

276
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:49,327
Come on, it's free.

277
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,372
Okay -- Ow!

278
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:51,852
[both laugh]

279
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:53,549
Alright.[cellphone camera clicks]

280
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,551
There it is.
There they are! Oh, my God!There ya go! There ya go!

281
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:56,683
Well, listen, I don't want to
take up too much of your time.

282
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:57,640
Thank you s--

283
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:58,902
I got all the time
in the world.

284
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,121
I'm not playing.
I'm just coaching.
Ohh.

285
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:01,470
Okay.
Yeah. Come here.

286
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,819
Let me tell you the story
about the Pine Tar game.

287
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,734
Oh, wow!
You wanna
hear that?

288
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:05,866
Sure.
Come on.

289
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:07,519
Okay.
But first, let me
tell you about --

290
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,696
I'm gonna tell you about dinner
the night before.
Oh.

291
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:14,614
You must be
the genius boyfriend.

292
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:16,137
That is what
the guys call me.

293
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:17,747
They're always,
like, you know,

294
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:21,272
"Hey, genius."
I'm like, "Hey, guys."

295
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:23,623
So, tell me,
are there aliens?

296
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:24,841
You kidding? 100%.

297
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,714
Oh, I knew it. Wait,
and the zombiepocalypse?

298
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:28,976
Dude, I tell everyone,

299
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:32,544
"Start building up an immunity
to zombie bites. Now."

300
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,764
I'm so glad we talked.

301
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:37,680
Um. Sorry for
the interruption.

302
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:38,681
Everything okay?

303
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:39,987
Well, the short story
is, yes.

304
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:41,118
The -- The long story is,

305
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,338
the theory
on which I've based

306
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,862
much of my career
has just been disproven.

307
00:10:45,993 --> 00:10:49,170
What? Your Vacuum
Energy Density Theory?
I'm -- I'm so sorry.

308
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,562
Me, too.

309
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:53,087
That was the density theory
I thought really worked.

310
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,089
Really, Phil, what
was your second choice?

311
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,787
Well, that's all part
of the process, isn't it?

312
00:10:57,918 --> 00:11:00,660
My theory actually invalidated
someone else's.
Mm.

313
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,401
He jumped off a building --

314
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:05,447
just very dramatic.

315
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:08,755
But, well, I'm British.
So, no worries.

316
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:10,234
[sighs]

317
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:12,802
What smells so good?Uh. Uh, it's the chicken!

318
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:15,544
So, Bill,
you are a firefighter?

319
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,720
Yeah, my three favorite things
are helping people,

320
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:20,375
sliding down poles,
and hanging off trucks,

321
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:22,856
so I figured might as well
make a career out of it.

322
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:23,900
Well, it's good that
your favorite things

323
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,643
weren't chloroform, duct tape,
and windowless vans.

324
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:29,123
[laughter]

325
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:32,735
Claire, the joke is
he'd be a kidnapper.

326
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:33,997
I got it.

327
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:36,870
You know, Phil used to think
it was "duck" tape.

328
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,436
[laughs]
Like, duck.

329
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,787
Claire didn't understand
the ending of La La Land.

330
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,615
Sorry. They're not
normally like this.

331
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:44,878
Clearly, they're
going through something

332
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:47,054
they can't even drop
for one important lunch.

333
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:48,229
They're arguing over
who's smarter,

334
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:49,709
and there's only one way
to settle it.

335
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,885
Another time, in the presence
of a marriage counselor?

336
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:52,799
Nope. Brain Battle.

337
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,017
No. No, we're not doing
that right now.

338
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,977
I'm so sorry, Arvin.
We're being silly.

339
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:58,674
"How many presidents
died in office?"

340
00:11:58,805 --> 00:11:59,806
-Eight.
-Six.

341
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,068
The correct answer
is eight.

342
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:03,418
Ha! Ha!
Damn it.
Give me another one.

343
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:05,289
Why was six afraid of seven?

344
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:08,858
'Cause seven, eight, nine.

345
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:10,381
[chuckles]

346
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:11,469
You know,
like he "ate" it.

347
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,819
"Who wrote Moby-Dick?"

348
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:14,908
Herman Munster.
HermanMunster.

349
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:16,953
Herman Melville.Melville!

350
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:19,477
"How many moons
does Jupiter have?"

351
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:23,699
Oh, is it alright
if I take this one?Mm-hmm.

352
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,919
27.
67.

353
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:28,008
Hmm? No, that's --
that's wrong.

354
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:32,534
67 is Uranus and Jupiter's 27,
right, Alex?

355
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:33,709
Actually, no.

356
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,972
But it's
a simple mistake, though.

357
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:37,495
You just flipped them.

358
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:38,801
Well, this is mortifying,
isn't it?

359
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:42,500
I have a doctorate
in astrophysics. Idiot.

360
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:46,722
First, some puffed-up Swedes
invalidate my life's work.

361
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:50,204
And then I'm bested by
a little bedtime gurgle cup!

362
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:53,294
I'm sorry.
I'm going to need a moment.

363
00:12:53,424 --> 00:12:55,557
67 moons.
What an idiot.

364
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:56,906
[footsteps]

365
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:58,865
Well, all's I know is

366
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,867
the Earth only has one moon

367
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:01,868
and I saw a documentary

368
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:04,000
and, uh, we didn't even
land on it.

369
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:06,002
Oh, my God,
stop talking.

370
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,876
You know,
you're being kind of mean.

371
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:11,225
I'm gonna need
a moment, too.

372
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:12,792
This is why I don't bring
boyfriends home.

373
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:15,969
Why didn't you ask me before
inviting him to lunch?

374
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:20,930
"This Paul Newman character
had a 'cool hand'?"

375
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:22,932
Luke!
Yep.

376
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:24,151
Counts! Counts.

377
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:29,373
Henry's dad climbed the wall
with one hand! It was awesome!

378
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:31,549
Yeah, well, his career
rides on Matt Damon

379
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,987
not doing any artsy,
think-y movies,

380
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:35,031
so I wouldn't
count on Henry

381
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:36,903
going to your school
much longer.[siren chirps]

382
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,688
[tires screech, siren wailing]

383
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,299
What the hell?
I made that light.

384
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,823
Oh, geez.
Another ticket.

385
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:46,173
Henry's mom drove a tank!

386
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:48,828
Henry's mom!
Henry's mom!

387
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,830
[engine revs]What are you doing,
Gloria?

388
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,788
I want to see
Henry's mom do this!

389
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:55,486
[tires screech]

390
00:13:55,617 --> 00:13:57,053
[siren wailing]

391
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:59,142
Yay! He's chasing us!

392
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,361
This feels like
a bad idea.

393
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:01,884
Okay, too late, because
I'm already committed!

394
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:03,364
[watch beeps]
Heart rate -- high.

395
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:05,583
Heart rate -- high.What is the plan,
Gloria?

396
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:06,758
We're going to the mall!

397
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,108
You know I tease you
about your shopping,

398
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:10,719
but you do
have a problem.

399
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,765
[tires screech]

400
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:16,725
Okay. Get down
and don't move.

401
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,076
That's gonna be tough.
I can smell Cinnabon.

402
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:24,907
Hey!

403
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:26,648
Where have you been?
Oh, hey.

404
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,215
I just stayed in the tank
a little -- a little extra.

405
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:29,303
How -- What a great
experience.

406
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,131
Just being alone
with yourself -- Oh!

407
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,567
Oh, I was never alone.

408
00:14:32,697 --> 00:14:34,003
I-I saw the face
of every bully,

409
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:36,179
I replayed every
humiliation --

410
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,398
Okay. Is this about
"Bett" Davis again?

411
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:39,748
Okay, we had just watched
Ruthless People.

412
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,098
You're thinking Midler.
You gotta let it go.

413
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:42,925
I know.
I'm -- I'm gonna try.

414
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,014
But as scared
as I was in there,

415
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:46,363
I kept thinking
about how

416
00:14:46,494 --> 00:14:48,148
you're the one person
who makes me feel safe.

417
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:51,238
And it -- it made me want to be
a better husband...
Aww.

418
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:52,369
...to be more present,

419
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,936
to be more understanding,
to --

420
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:57,157
Why's --
Why's your face red?Oh, is it?

421
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:58,375
Yeah.
Is it?

422
00:14:58,506 --> 00:14:59,594
Oh, just probably 'cause
of the toxins, you know --

423
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:00,812
And your arms, too,
but only up to the --

424
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,945
You have a farmer's tan.

425
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:05,121
What have I told you
about that expression?
I can say it, but --

426
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,863
Oh, my --
T-That's why you're burned.

427
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,125
You went Royal watching!

428
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:10,910
I was only gonna stay for
a second, but George Brett --

429
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,259
George -- George Brett
cornered me.

430
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:13,651
Who?
And you know how I am
with famous people.

431
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:14,870
I can't say "No."

432
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:17,090
Remember when I spent
the entire day at the pool

433
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,352
with Downtown Julie Brown?

434
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:19,831
You shamed me
into coming here

435
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,791
only to leave me soaking in a --
in a bowl of trauma soup?

436
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,053
Okay, whoa, whoa.
W-What happened about be--

437
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:25,359
being more understanding?

438
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,056
I-I can't believe you're turning
this into my fault.

439
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:28,188
This is so like you, Cam.
This --

440
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:29,580
Hello, again.

441
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:32,409
Please follow me to
your guided silent meditation.

442
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,151
Before we begin,

443
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:37,937
the chef has asked me
to reassure everyone

444
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:40,069
that there's nothing wrong
with the tempeh.

445
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,029
It's supposed to
taste that way.

446
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,030
Alright.

447
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,076
Deep breath.
In through the nose.

448
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:48,512
Out through the mouth.

449
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:52,038
Only in silence can we
be truly present.

450
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:53,691
But be prepared --

451
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:55,955
errant feelings may arise.

452
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:59,697
Anxiety, doubt, anger...

453
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:01,134
Now, take a breath

454
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:05,138
and let those feelings pass
like clouds in the sky.

455
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:08,054
The tension is melting away.

456
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:09,707
That's it.

457
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:15,931
Live in this moment of serenity
and stillness.

458
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:19,195
We're so accustomed to
going, going, going.

459
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:23,025
But we need to just stop.

460
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:25,114
Ask yourself
the important questions.

461
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:29,292
Are you running away
from difficult feelings?

462
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,946
[no audio]

463
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,775
Are you holding on
to petty grievances?

464
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,475
Are you being the best you?

465
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:42,044
It's not too late
to find your way back.

466
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:44,351
To the light,

467
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:47,093
to forgiveness,

468
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:50,052
to love.

469
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:51,053
It was amazing.

470
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:52,315
There were no words,

471
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:53,969
but I could feel Cam

472
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,319
taking full responsibility
for our fight.

473
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,279
Total silence,
but Mitchell's eyes said,

474
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:00,715
"It's all on me."

475
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:03,935
You know, "I was wrong.
What would I do without you?"

476
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,589
It was a beautiful weekend.

477
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,069
Plus, George Brett
signed my ball.

478
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,331
[chuckles]

479
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:10,768
Oh, "To Cam, all my best wishes,
George Brett.

480
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:13,902
P.S. We are not done with this"?

481
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,251
Mitchell!

482
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:17,558
Did you write on my ball?!

483
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:21,127
Hey, where's Bill?

484
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:22,693
I don't know.
He's probably outside.

485
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:25,000
When he gets agitated,
he likes to climb stuff.

486
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:28,047
That lunch was insane.
Can you believe Mom and Dad?

487
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:30,571
No, and, uh,
I can't believe you, either.

488
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:32,051
You're so mean to Bill.

489
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:33,356
What do you have
against hot people?

490
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:35,532
What did we ever
do to you?
You lost me.

491
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:37,012
You're gonna blow it
with that guy,

492
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:38,274
and he's really nice.

493
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:40,320
Why do you have to
make him feel so dumb?

494
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,930
Okay, you don't know
what you're talking about.

495
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,192
Oh, yes, I do.

496
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:45,281
Because it's the same way
you've always treated me.

497
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:46,587
It sucks.

498
00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:49,068
You know what Arvin
never does?

499
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:50,373
Makes me feel
less smart than him.

500
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:53,159
So, who cares if Bill's
not a member of Menses?

501
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,639
Look, this is the first
boyfriend you've ever had

502
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,989
that is age appropriate,
employed,

503
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,253
and doesn't look like
he's dying on a ship.

504
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:01,167
I wouldn't say
"boyfriend."

505
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:03,604
He's more like
a guilty pleasure.

506
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:05,562
Guilty or not, that's the first
time I've ever heard you

507
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,521
describe a guy
as a "pleasure."

508
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,965
Bill, I'm sorry!

509
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,184
BILL: All good, babe.

510
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:20,882
You're the one fire
I can't put out.

511
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:23,363
Well, also grease
is pretty tricky.

512
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,671
Arvin?

513
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:29,369
TOGETHER: Oh.

514
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:31,110
Arvin, hi.
Are you okay?

515
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,546
Yeah. Oh, yes. Yes.

516
00:18:32,676 --> 00:18:33,634
Um...yes.

517
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:37,072
I-I'm -- I'm just
a-a little embarrassed.

518
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:38,291
We're the ones who should
be embarrassed.

519
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:41,032
We just made lunch
so tense and weird.

520
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,077
Yeah.
Well, I'm --

521
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,254
I'm not terribly adept
at handling failure.

522
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:49,084
My parents are both
overachieving academics --

523
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,608
a doctor of philosophy and a --
a doctor of mathematics.

524
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:52,696
Oh.
Wow!

525
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,133
And Father is
a doctor of medicine

526
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:56,396
and a doctor of economics.

527
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:59,268
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I-I just need to shake it off.

528
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:00,835
You know,
stiff-upper-lip it.

529
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:02,184
[chuckles]
Yeah, it's fine.

530
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:04,099
Can we just pretend
it never happened?

531
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,274
No.

532
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:07,276
No, failure sucks.

533
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:09,452
It's okay to feel bad.

534
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,280
Yeah, wallow a little.
Eat some ice cream.

535
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:13,848
Day drink, that's how you
come out the other side.

536
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:15,023
[clicks tongue]

537
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,678
You're -- You're like
the inverse of my parents.

538
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:19,245
Except the drinking.

539
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,855
They're pickled
most of the day.

540
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:23,423
Well, you're not
in their house.

541
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:26,339
This is House Dunphy --
We fail here.

542
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:27,818
Right. I mean,
today our whole goal

543
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:29,864
was to impress you.
We made fools of ourselves.

544
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:32,258
I have a magic shop that's
bleeding money -- thousands.

545
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:34,173
What?
It's fine.

546
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:35,609
Hey, what's all this, then?
Oh, whoa.

547
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:38,046
Did I get that from you?
Am I becoming Madonna?

548
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,527
Your parents were actually
being quite lovely.

549
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:42,703
Thank you for
taking the time.

550
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:46,924
Oh, and my parents' walls
may be adorned

551
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:48,622
with nothing
but degrees and awards,

552
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:53,627
but they don't have one tenth
of your emotional intelligence.

553
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:55,759
Aww!
Thank you.

554
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,849
But would you say it's an
absolutely equal emotional...If you had to
pick a winner --

555
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,068
Okay, stop it....intelligence.
Just --

556
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,939
[footsteps]

557
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,333
That was so fun.

558
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:05,769
My heart is racing.

559
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,294
You? My watch dialed
my cardiologist.

560
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:10,513
I've never run
from the cops before.

561
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:12,167
Me either.[siren chirps]

562
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,300
Lights!

563
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,694
I can't wait to tell everyone
how cool you guys are!

564
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:19,218
We're not cool, Joe.

565
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:20,697
That's not
what people do

566
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:22,003
when a policeman
pulls them over.

567
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:23,918
In fact, there's nothing
cool about us.

568
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:26,007
Well, I don't think
we should be lumped into --

569
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:28,009
[siren chirps]Lights!

570
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:30,359
Joe, there are more important
things than being cool.

571
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,100
Uh, like what?

572
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,493
Look, the point is, Joe,
we love you too much

573
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:37,018
to let you think dumb moves
like this are okay.

574
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:39,934
So, what do we do now?

575
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:41,544
We're gonna do
the right thing.

576
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:43,894
[seat belt clicks]

577
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,246
[vehicle door closes]

578
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:48,943
Officer!

579
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:50,161
Uh...

580
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:56,516
Where's Cinnabon?

581
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:01,390
GEORGE:
Sure enough, they call me out
for using too much pine tar.

582
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:04,785
I run out there and just go
berserk on these umpires.

583
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:06,265
But everybody
remembers --Ugh!

584
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:07,570
Watch out.
That's a base.Yeah. Yeah.

585
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:08,963
That's third base.Third base.

586
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:10,356
That's where I used to play.
You remember that?

587
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:11,966
Yeah. Yeah.
Should we do --

588
00:21:12,096 --> 00:21:13,707
So, when you would
stand here,

589
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:15,578
you would just kind of basically
be in an athletic --

590
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:17,014
I played college
football --You would get here.

591
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:18,625
GEORGE: You would get
right here like this and say,

592
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:20,017
"Please don't
hit it to me."

593
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:21,018
[both laugh]

594
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:22,368
CAM:
That's how I feel!

595
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:23,804
I'm gonna get you back!

596
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:25,371
[laughs]

597
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:31,072
